          </h2>
          <p>
            We're the team behind NoBull! We have to confess, there's really just the three of us (dog not pictured above, don't worry, she makes an appearance below!). And honestly, our dog doesn't do much besides sleep, snort and provide moral support.
            We're a married couple, both from Canada, in our mid-twenties and can be found currently in <strong>Warwick, Warwickshire, UK!</strong> 
          </p>
          <h3 class="h4">Rich Smith</h3>
          <p>
            Rich is the programmer behind NoBull. After studying Economics and Business, it was a bit of a surprise to everyone when he announced that he was going to be a programmer. But program he did. 
          </p>
          <p>
            After spending nearly five months locked away from the world in a family cabin teaching himself to code, he came back a full-stack web developer. With skills under his belt such as Ruby/Rails, PHP, Elixir/Phoenix and of course the required
            HTML5/CSS3/JS (the must-haves), Rich is a brilliant full-stack web developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Growing up in the beautiful town of Salmon Arm, BC, Canada, it's no wonder Rich is a connoisseur of the outdoors - enjoying a wide range of activities from alpinism and summer hiking, to downhill skiing and whitewater kayaking. Rich is very fond of clean datasets, large breakfasts, his beautiful wife and his dog. After moving from Calgary to Barcelona in 2017, he has since moved to Warwick in the United Kingdom, taking full advantage of his ability to work from anywhere in the world with clients from across the globe.
          </p>
          <h3 class="h4">Chanelle Mather-Shapiro</h3>
          <p>
            Chanelle is the part-time wordsmith or copywriter behind NoBull. With a masters in Economics and a speciality in Behavioural Science - the art of the subtly nudging behaviour - she reworks the written content and flow of our custom websites for you, ensuring your site visitors convert to 
           clients. She studied at the prestigious Pompeu Fabra BGSE in Barcelona and is now working as a behavioural scientist in the legal industry in the UK. She has a particular knack for rewording content and making difficult concepts easy to understand. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Chanelle grew up in the lovely city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada which gave her easy access to enjoy the beautiful hiking in the Rocky Mountains. Chanelle loves the outdoors just as much as her husband. Perhaps that's why they get along so well! Chanelle has recently picked up rock climbing and white water kayaking, and is living with her husband (and soon her dog as well) in the cute 
            market town of Warwick, where she commutes into Birmingham on the daily.
          </p>
          <h3 class="h4">Rossi the Dog</h3>
            <p>
              While not known for a solid work ethic, Rossi is more an 'enjoy the finer things in life' kind of gal. A chocolate lab with a chunky, stocky build, she's always been a lover of food, belly rubs, snuggles and chasing the odd squirrel.
              She is still unsure what to think about moving to the UK, but she's very excited about prospective full English breakfast scraps!
            </p>

                ‚ÄúThat's the thing about being a Labrador retriever - you were born for fun. Seldom was your loopy, freewheeling mind cluttered by contemplation, and never at all by somber worry; every day was a romp. What else could there possibly be to life? Eating was a thrill. 
                Pissing was a treat. Shitting was a joy. And licking your own balls? Bliss. And everywhere you went were gullible humans who patted and hugged and fussed over you.‚Äù
