              A custom webapp can be, well, anything that runs in a web browser! It could be building anything from making your business a tool to help send customers quotes to building you the next Facebook. 
              Also included in this category is E-Commerce. We can help you get your business selling online through Shopify or whatever other platforms you require. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Since those all of those are vastly different things, and have very different time requirements, we need to price accordingly and so as a result, you're going to have to request a custom quote for this one. We try and be as transparent on pricing as we can, but hey this stuff is complex ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 
            </p>
            <p>Our toolbox includes working in Ruby/Rails (our prefered language!), Elixir/Phoenix, PHP and Javascript. If you have something in mind, get in touch.</p>

                This website is a perfect example of writing code to solve a business problem. Building this website including its backend webapp probably took me about 50hours. 
                However, by building a space where clients are able to upload all their photos and business information in one place will give me an estimated savings of around four hours per website I build.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's only a 13-website payoff! It also means a <strong>much</strong> better experience customer experience, which hopefully results in more word-of-mouth marketing.
              </p>
              <p>
                As stated, the website took roughly 50 hours to build, which means it would cost around $3250 to build. The application was built in Ruby on Rails.
