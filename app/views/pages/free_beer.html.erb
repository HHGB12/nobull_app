          <p>At NoBull, we're doing our best to let our name and the quality of our work speak for itself. We want people to come to us because they want great quality at a fair price. So far, that's worked out pretty well .  </p>
          <p>
            That said, word-of-mouth is a major part of how we get new clients. Like all (we hope) small businesses, we really appreciate it when someone sends us a new client. 
            We take it as a major compliment and truly appreciate it when people do that. It means a lot to us that you'd trust your reputation on our work, which is 
            exactly why we've decided to show you our appreciation with a little gift as our way of saying 'Thanks, we really appreciate it! 😊'. So here's what we're going to do:
          </p> 
          <h3 class="h4 text-center mx-10 mb-10">For every referral you send us, we'll make sure to send a case of beer your way 🙌</h3>

          <p>
            What? Did you think we'd send you a thank you card and a coupon for McDonalds? 😝 No way, this is the real McCoy! Make some space in your fridge for 24 cold ones, coming your way!
          </p>
            <ol class="text-center">
             <span class="text-underline"> Here's how it works:</span>
              <li>You know someone who needs or is looking for a web developer</li>
              <li>You send them our direction (make sure you ask them to mention that it was you who recommended us!) </li>
              <li> If they end up spending money with us, <strong>we'll send you a case of beer.</strong></li>
              <li>If you see that they got a new website, and you didn't get a case of beer, get in touch (it probably means they forgot to mention you - rude! 😠) and we'll send you that case of beer you earned.</li>
              <li><span class="bigger">🍻🎊🥂🎉🙌</span></li>
            </ol>
          <p>
            Not all that into Beer? No worries - not everyone is! Perhaps you're a Rum/Bourbon or Wine kind of person? 😉 We'll get in touch to see what your drink 
            of choice is beforehand, so no worries. Not a drinker? Also not a problem - let us buy you Timmies or Starbucks for the month with a gift card instead!
          </p>
          <p>This isn't meant to be complex - it's just meant to give us a chance to say <em> thanks, we really do appreciate you trusting us with your referral. </em></p>
