  <p>
    With the world gone digital, people today tend to expect a lot more info before they'll visit or even call a business. The reality is, people want to know what they're getting into before they actually do. Fair enough.
  </p>
  <p>
    Which is why this section is so important. While you don't need to offer prices (but if you can, most potential customers tend to appreciate it), it would certainly be best if you gave me plenty of detail to work with
    when describing the services your business offers. 
  </p>
  <p>So, while filling out all fields isn't nessecary, filling out at least one, and filling it out well is. </p>
